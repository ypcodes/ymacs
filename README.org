* Intro
This is my emacs configuration. I have use [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom Emacs]] a long time, but
recently I am a little dislike it, so I am going to roll my own
configuration from scratch.

* Install
First backup emacs config files:
#+begin_src shell
  mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.bak
#+end_src

Then clone this repository:
#+begin_src shell
  git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/ypcodes/ymacs.git ~/.emacs.d
#+end_src

* Adding your own customization
User's configuration should be located in ~$HOME/.ymacs.d/config.el~,
which should look like this:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; your code here

  (provide 'config)
#+end_src

Note that a better way for PDF reading or music playing etc is a package
called [[https://github.com/emacs-eaf/emacs-application-framework][Emacs Application Framework]], but I don't use it because of my
gentoo.
